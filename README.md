# SLAM-Resources-for-Beginner

SLAM is an abbreviation for **"Simultaneous localization and mapping"**.  

SLAM is a field with high entry barriers for beginners.  

As a beginner learning SLAM, I created this repository to organize resources that can be used as a reference when learning SLAM for the first time.  

I made this repository based on the content from the [SLAM KR community]() and the activities of [my github followers](https://github.com/Taeyoung96?tab=following)!  

If you are Korean, you will prefer to look [korean.md](https://github.com/Taeyoung96/SLAM-Resources-for-Beginner/blob/master/korean.md).
